## Introduction
Strati functional is a set of functional classes intended to make the Java development experience
more intuitive and less cumbersome. One of the main purposes of this library is to allow types
to communicate side-effects via highly compositional types. The library currently exposes the following types:

<1> *Optional* - container for handling nullable values (composable alternative to `java.util.Optional`)
<2> *Try* - container for handling failures (based on `scala.util.Try`)
<3> *LazyTry* - compose failable actions in a lazy manner (i.e. defer execution)
<4> *CircuitBreaker* - improve stability and resilience by preventing your system from repeatedly trying to execute an operation that is likely to fail

These types can be used to make (commonly implicit) effects explicit in the type signatures of your code.
This allows much more safety and readability since the types tell a larger part of the story as to what happens when
particular methods are invoked.

## Optional<T>

For example take the following method signature:

[source,java]
----
public <T> T getFirst(Collection<T> collection)
----

The intent of this method is to return only the first element from the collection that is given as input.
When we read the method signature it tells us that the method takes a `Collection<T>` as input and it returns a
value of type `T`. But what happens when the given collection is empty? The method signature only tells us what
happens in the "happy path". In most cases developers choose to simply return `null` when there is no value that
can be returned. Returning `null` is an example of an implicit effect that isn't represented in our type signature.
To make this nullable effect explicit we can change the method signature as follows:

[source,java]
----
public <T> Optional<T> getFirst(Collection<T> collection)
----

Notice that the return type now explicitly states that the method will "optionally" return a value of type `T`.
An `Optional` can be either an instance of `Present` (which contains a value) or an instance of `Empty`
(which contains no value).

[source,java]
----
public abstract class Optional<T> { ... }
final class Present<T> extends Optional<T> { ... }
final class Empty<T> extends Optional<T> { ... }
----

Let's look at an example of how we can use this type to refactor code that handles nullable values.

[source,java]
----
Person person = personCache.find(name);
if (person != null) {
    Address address = person.getAddress();
    if (address != null) {
        City city = address.getCity();
        if (city != null) {
            process(city);
        }
    }
}
----

The above example shows how multiple levels of `null` checks need to be nested in order to account for all the possible
null values that might occur at runtime. If we change the return types to utilize `Optional<T>` to make the nullable
effect explicit we might naively rewrite the above example to the following:

[source,java]
----
Optional<Person> person = personCache.find(name);
if (person.isPresent()) {
    Optional<Address> address = person.get().getAddress();
    if (address.isPresent()) {
        Optional<City> city = address.get().getCity();
        if (city.isPresent()) {
            process(city.get());
        }
    }
}
----

The benefit of switching to `Optional` is that the calling side is now forced to perform the check, the nullable effect
is no longer implicit. However we haven't gained much in terms of code style as the code still looks quite similar to
the first version. This brings us to the next great benefit of using an explicit type to encode side-effects:
*composability*!
Since `Optional` is just an ordinary type it comes with many convenience methods that allow us to abstract away many
common patterns that we encounter when dealing with nullable values. These methods are composable in that they allow
us to "wire" together multiple nullable values and actions without leaving the typesafe `Optional` context.
To illustrate this, the proper way to rewrite the above example is as follows:

[source,java]
----
personCache.find(name)
           .flatMap(Person::getAddress)
           .flatMap(Address::getCity)
           .ifPresent(this::process);
----

Firstly notice that Optional allows for a functional style (i.e. expression-based rather than imperative
statement-based). This is of course a matter of taste and not enforced, you're still free to split up the expression
into multiple statements if that's your preference. Another interesting fact to notice is that by using the
compositional methods `flatMap` and `ifPresent` the code becomes much more concise and easily readable (granted, it
might take some time to get used to this functional expression-based style). Even more interestingly, our code is now
completely safe from null pointers (and hence from `NullPointerExceptions`) but we haven't written a single null check
ourselves! The methods defined on `Optional` abstract the details of null handling away from us in a type-safe
container. All we need to do is compose the appropriate actions together within the `Optional` context.

*Pro tip*: _Make maximum use of the composable methods and avoid calling `Optional.get()` as much as possible!_


## Why a custom Optional?!

By now you might be thinking: the JDK already comes with the `java.util.Optional` implementation, why did we decide to
implement our own custom version?
The answer is simply because `java.util.Optional` isn't composable enough. Especially in cases where you want to
specify actions to take when no value is present, i.e. in the `Empty` optional case, `java.util.Optional` doesn't
help us out and forces us to write imperative manual checks again. For example, we want to eliminate the need for code
like the following:

[source,java]
----
Optional<Foo> opt = getSomeOptional();
if (opt.isSuccess()) {
    doSomething(opt.get());
} else {
    doSomethingElse();
}
----

In favor of:

[source,java]
----
getSomeOptional()
    .ifPresent(this::doSomething)
    .ifEmpty(this::doSomethingElse);
----

There are many other reasons that we considered but composability is by far the most important one.

### An overview of the differences between our Optional and java.util.Optional:

* `ifPresent` returns `Optional` instead of `void` so that expressions don't have to be broken up in order to do side-effects (i.e. perform actions)
* added `isEmpty()`
* added `ifEmpty(Runnable runnable)`, for performing side-effects in the empty case (also returns `Optional`).
* `flatMap` returns `empty` if `mapper` function returns `null` instead of throwing `NullPointerException`.
* added `orElseMap(Supplier<? extends T> mapper)`, to allow mapping a value in the empty case (like `Try.recover`).
* added `orElseFlatMap(Supplier<? extends Optional<? extends T>> mapper)`, to allow flatMapping in the empty case (like `Try.recoverWith`).
* added `stream()`, to convert to a Stream that contains 0 or 1 elements, mainly for easier composition with Stream API.
* added `toTry` to convert to `Success` if a value is present, otherwise `Failure` with `NoSuchElementException`.

*Note*: _This implementation is backwards compatible with `java.util.Optional` in order to facilitate easy adoption._


## Try<T>

Whereas `Optional<T>` helps us to deal with nullable values, the `Try<T>` type helps us to deal with computations/actions
that can potentially fail. Our aim is again to provide a type that makes this effect explicit and allows compositional
methods that abstract common patterns away from the user.

`Try` is very similar to `Optional` in that an instance of `Try` can either be a `Success` or a `Failure`. If it's
a `Success` then it contains the value of type `T`, if it's a `Failure` then it contains a `Throwable` to identify
the cause of the failure.

[source,java]
----
public abstract class Try<T> { ... }
final class Success<T> extends Try<T> { ... }
final class Failure<T> extends Try<T> { ... }
----

Now you might be thinking: Why do I need the `Try` type? I can already make the failure effect explicit in my type
signatures with `throws` clauses. Strictly speaking that is true, but unfortunately checked exceptions are a special
construct in the Java language rather than a first-class citizen like ordinary types. This basically means that
the only thing we can do with a method signature that specifies a `throws` clause is to wrap it in a `try/catch` block
or re-throw it for the next caller to figure out what to do. This isn't the compositional way of dealing with failures
that we're looking for. Having an ordinary type that represent failable computations/actions allows us to specify
methods that abstract away common patterns of failure handling while providing a composable interface.

Let's look at how we can use the `Try` type to make failure handling more convenient and maintainable.

[source,java]
----
User user = null;
try {
    user = getUserFromCache(userId);
} catch (NoSuchElementException nee) {
    try {
        user = getUserFromDatabase(userId);
    } catch (IOException ioe) {
        try {
            user = createUser(new User());
        } catch (IOException e) {
            // now what? log? fail?
        }
    }
} finally {
    try {
        update(user);
    } catch (Exception e) {
        // now what? log? fail?
    }
}
----

In the above example we first want to try to get a user from some cache, if that fails we will try the database, and
if that fails as well we will fall back to a dummy/default user instance. Finally we want to run some `update` logic on
the user instance. This example (although a bit paranoid) shows how we compose failable actions when using the
`throws` mechanism of the Java language. We end up with nested `try/catch` blocks and still we often hit cases where we
don't really know how to handle the failing situation at this point so we're forced to either hide that situation or
propagate the error to the caller via another `throws` clause. The example also demonstrates that this style of
programming prevents us from focusing on "the essence" of what we're trying to do because of all the boilerplate
involved with failure handling.

When we adopt the `Try` type we can refactor the example above to the following:

[source,java]
----
Try.ofFailable(() -> getUserFromCache(userId))
   .recover(e -> getUserFromDatabase(userId))
   .recover(e -> createUser(new User()))
   .map(user -> update(user));
----

Again we notice that all the boilerplate is gone and the actual details of failure handling are abstracted away, we
simply use the error handling methods that `Try` provides. Notice that in this refactoring we don't even have to
change the method signatures of the methods involved. We simply wrap the initial call in a `Try` via `Try.ofFailable()`.
Of course it's cleaner to refactor our existing method signatures to return a `Try`, but since that's not always a
possibility we can also refactor in a slightly less intrusive way.

Notice also that we have achieved a situation in which we have added failure handling in a type-safe way to our
code, without actually doing any explicit failure handling ourselves. The code is a lot more readable from the
perspective that we only express "the essence" of what we're trying to accomplish and leave out all the boilerplate
that's involved in failure handling.


## LazyTry<T>

There are certain situations in which we would like to compose a chain of computations/actions without directly
executing them. Although `Try` allows us to perform the composition, due to its eager nature a `Try`-based expression
will be executed directly. To allow for the composition in a lazy manner the `LazyTry` type is supplied.
Using `LazyTry` we are able to compose actions however we like, without actually executing them. Later on, when it's
actually required we can trigger the execution by calling `LazyTry.run()`. This will execute the whole chain of
actions and return the result in the form of a `Try<T>`. Essentially the `LazyTry` is a simple wrapper for the `Try`
type which defers the actual execution until a later point.

Let's look at an example of how `LazyTry` can used:

[source,java]
----
public LazyTry<Application> saveOrUpdate(final Application app) {
    return tagService.createTags(app.getTags())
                     .flatMap(() -> policyService.createPolicies(app.getPolicies()).run())
                     .flatMap(() -> catalogService.createCatalogs(app.getCatalogs()).run())
                     .flatMap(() -> ownerService.createOwners(evaluateOwners(app)).run())
                     .map(() -> dataService.saveOrUpdate(app));
}
----

The above example composes several database interactions in the context of a `LazyTry`. This essentially makes the
`saveOrUpdate` method lazy in that invoking `saveOrUpdate` doesn't actually do anything other than prepare some
composition of actions to be executed at some later point in time:

[source,java]
----
LazyTry<Application> saveAction = saveOrUpdate(app);

...

saveAction.run();
----

This allows us to do interesting things, for example suppose that we want to perform some dynamic behaviour to perform
this action in the context of some transaction (so that a failure at any point in the chain rolls back all other
actions as well). We can implement that in a single class that takes a `LazyTry`, executes it in the context of the
transaction, and returns the result as a `Try`.

[source,java]
----
LazyTry<Application> saveAction = saveOrUpdate(app);

...

saveAction.apply(lazyTryTransaction::run);
----

Lazy evaluation/execution allows us to abstract away even more patterns that were much more difficult in the past.


## CircuitBreaker

Implementation of the circuit breaker pattern, proposed by Michael T. Nygard. This pattern is used to improve stability and resilience of an application. More specifically it's used to prevent your application from repeatedly trying to execute operations that are likely to fail. The basic idea is to protect a failable action by wrapping it in a circuit breaker instance which monitors for failures. Once a given failure threshold is reached the circuit breaker will "open" (i.e. trip) so that subsequent calls will be blocked until a given amount of time has passed. The implementation and pattern are best described by the following state diagram:

image:https://github.com/strati/strati-functional/raw/master/CB-states.png["Circuit Breaker state diagram"]

The circuit breaker has three states: CLOSED, HALF_OPEN and OPEN. In the CLOSED state the circuit breaker will allow all calls to the protected operation to go through normally while maintaining a failure count. Once the number of failures reaches a given threshold the circuit breaker will transition into the OPEN state. In this state all calls to the protected operation are blocked as they are likely to fail. Once a given amount of time has passed the circuit breaker goes into the HALF_OPEN state. The circuit breaker will allow a call to the protected operation to be made, on failure it will directly open the circuit again, on success it will directly go to the CLOSED state.

Usage example:

[source,java]
----
CircuitBreaker cb = CircuitBreakerBuilder.create()
        .threshold(13)
        .timeout(1337)
        .stateChangeListener(() -> LOGGER.info(...))
        .build();

...

cb.attempt(() -> someFailableOperation()).recover(e -> someFallbackOperation());
